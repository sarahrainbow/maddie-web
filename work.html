<h2>Anna Meredith</h2>

<p>Maddie is a permanent member of the band for Anna Meredith, and collaborated&nbsp;with Anna on her second album&nbsp;<em><a href="https://annameredith.plctrmm.to/">FIBS</a>, </em>which was shortlisted for the 2020 <a href="https://www.mercuryprize.com/news/the-2020-hyundai-mercury-prize-albums-of-the-year">Hyundai Mercury Award</a> and dubbed <a href="https://electronicsound.co.uk/product/issue-60-pdf-edition/">Electronic Sound&#39;s</a> &#39;Album of the Year 2019&#39;&nbsp;. Prior to this, Maddie toured extensively in 2016, 2017 and 2018 across Europe and the US with the band to promote the debut album <i>Varmints</i> (Scottish Album of the Year). After completing the second album in early 2019, the band released their first&nbsp;single&nbsp;<em>Paramour</em>, as well as an Augmented Reality app for the track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5p9DLkpQ28"><em>moonmoons</em></a>&nbsp;for solo cello and electronics which Maddie collaborated closely with Anna on during&nbsp;her writing process. You can download the moonmoons app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/moonmoons-ar/id1473847192?mt=8">here</a>&nbsp;. Their performance at SXSW Austin, Texas in 2017 was described by the New York Times as &ldquo;sheer exhilaration&rdquo; and by NPR as &ldquo;a stormy, ecstatic, endlessly danceable thrill to behold...the best artist I&lsquo;ve seen at SXSW and one of the most creative bands I&lsquo;ve seen in years. Music for the head, the heart, the ass and the feet&rdquo;. This reaction spurred on an invitation to perform in an NPR Tiny Desk concert during their following tour of the US in early 2018. The band&nbsp;featured alongside Southbank Sinfonia, conducted by <a href="http://www.simon-dobson.co.uk/">Simon Dobson</a>, for an orchestral concert of <i>Varmints</i> at Southbank&nbsp;Centre&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth Hall, Edinburgh International Festival and at Birmingham Town Hall. They&nbsp;also took&nbsp;<em>Varmints with Orchestra&nbsp;</em>to Holland and Georgia, to perform alongside Simon Dobson&nbsp;with both the Noordpool Orkest&nbsp;and the Tblisi Youth Orchestra.</p>

<h2>Parallax Orchestra</h2>

<p>In 2015 Maddie co-founded <a href="http://parallaxorchestra.com">Parallax Orchestra</a>, an ensemble specialising in combining orchestral performances with live and recorded bands, which debuted at the Royal Albert Hall with&nbsp;Bring Me The Horizon&nbsp;for their special Teenage Cancer Trust concert in April 2015. Parallax Orchestra has since collaborated with rock giants Alter Bridge for two nights at the Royal Albert Hall with a 40-piece orchestra in October 2017, and their live DVD of the show was longlisted for the Grammys in 2018. Parallax Orchestra recently performed a WarChild concert of Bethesda Studios video-game music at Hammersmith Apollo, featuring compositions taken from the globally renowned games <i>Skyrim</i> and <i>Fallout</i> from the <i>Elder Scrolls Series</i>. In smaller ensembles, Maddie has performed live with other members of Parallax Orchestra (including Will Harvey, the co-founder and Managing Director of the orchestra) for acts such as Lewis Capaldi, Paolo Nutini,&nbsp;Deacon Blue, Whitney and Dermot Kennedy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Session Work</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color:#FF8C00;">&lt;COVID-19 UPDATE: Maddie has a full home studio set-up - for any recording enquiries during (or after) the pandemic, please email me at the address on the </span><a href="http://maddiecutter.co.uk/html/contact.html"><span style="background-color:#FF8C00;">Contact</span></a><span style="background-color:#FF8C00;"> page&gt;</span></p>

<p>Maddie&rsquo;s&nbsp;passion for a variety of different music styles has gained her a reputation as a session player on the London scene, playing on BBC Radio 1, 1Xtra 2, 3 and 6 Music at Broadcasting House and Maida Vale and taking residency as cellist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.petermiles.com">Middle Farm Studios</a>&nbsp;in Devon.&nbsp;Maddie has featured on&nbsp;Bring Me The Horizon&rsquo;s album&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/thats-the-spirit/id1021582747">That&rsquo;s The Spirit</a>, which reached #1 in the Australian album charts and #2 in UK album charts, and more recently on their album Amo, which reached #1 in the UK album charts in February 2019.</p>

<p>She also plays in sessions for <a href="http://orchestratecltv.com/">Orchestrate</a>, recording for TV series such as <i>Troy</i> and <i>Tin Star</i>, and features on the soundtrack for The Haxan Cloak&#39;s score of <em>Midsommar</em>, and on Tom Beard&rsquo;s directional debut film <i>Two For Joy</i>.</p>

<p>Her open-minded approach to improvisation, and appreciation for music from other cultures, has led her to collaborations with musicians from around the globe. This includes work with Kadialy Kouyate (kora player) and Jasdeep Singh Degun (sitar), and in 2014 Maddie travelled to Senegal to learn the basics of how to play the Kora herself, tutored by Adam Doughty.</p>
