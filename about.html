<blockquote><i>&ldquo;&hellip; with the violins creating raindrops by bouncing pencils on their strings, that drizzled over Maddie Cutter&rsquo;s spotless cello playing.&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Reaction</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>&ldquo;Cellist Maddie Cutter was rapturous in &lsquo;Honeyed Words&rsquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Financial Times</blockquote>
&nbsp;

<p>Since graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 2016 with a BMus (Hons), Maddie has quickly gained a reputation as a collaborative and versatile cellist.</p>

<p>As co-founder and principal cellist of Parallax Orchestra, Maddie has become well-known in both the freelance classical, and the pop, rock and alternative music scenes. She has performed and recorded with Bring Me The Horizon and Alter Bridge, as well as featured in live shows with artists such as Paolo Nutini, Lewis Capaldi, Money, Whitney&nbsp;and Deaf Havana. Maddie has toured regularly around the US and Europe with Anna Meredith for the past 3 years, and has been on UK tours with&nbsp;Japanese electronic musician Anchorsong and British band Money.</p>

<p>Maddie&rsquo;s open-minded approach to music and composition has led her to perform in a number of theatres across London, including for multiple productions at Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe Theatre and an RSC production at Theatre Royal Haymarket. Maddie was the first ever musician to be employed at The Bridge Theatre, playing Grant Olding&rsquo;s score for solo cello and loop pedals for Lucinda Coxon&rsquo;s adaptation of <em>Alys Always</em>. She has also worked alongside composers such as Isobel Waller-Bridge, Alex Baranowski, Stephen Warbeck and Tom Lane.</p>
